	<h1>Why I Cheated In My First Programming Class And How It Fueled Me To Pursue Programming.</h1>


	<p>My first programming class at NJIT was CS115 (Intro to C++). From the moement I first entered the class I dreaded it. The professor with whom I registered for being suddenly very ill and was unable to teach the class for the entire semester. NJIT hired an adjunt professor from a county college, being me I stayed optimistic hoping that my dreams of learning how to program would come true. Those dreams died during that semester. The professor came into the class with absolutley no materials prepared.  In my head," He was asked last minute to fill for the professor, maybe after the weekend he'll come prepared." so I gave him a break. <br>
	Next week we have class again and he comes with slidesshows. Finally! Then I noticed that the slideshows were from the textbok. Ok  and had noLaster did we know that NJIT would hire him for the rest of the semester.</p>
